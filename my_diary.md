# My Daily Diary
## 16-11-2024
Today I've started writing my diary to capture what I've done or learnt today---

hello this is my continuos entry
Hmm, I've been feeling little down today. When I put my son to bed, cuddling him, I thought about Ella, and Lizz and her family. They have been going through hell at the moment. I just hope that Ella, the miracle child, will again get through this challenge. 

As a mom to child at the same age as Ella and been following her journey since her birth, I understand their struggles and pain. Man, it feels horrible even though I'm just a stranger. I can't fanthom how the parents are feeling at the moment, knowing their child has got a huge hermorrage and the doctors cannot do the operation...Ella, Fighting, Ella!
